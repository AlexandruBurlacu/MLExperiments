# MLExperiments

Here are some of my machine learning, deep learning and data engineering experiments.

Some of them are WIP.

Currently there is a single Apache Spark [Word Count project](./spark-wordcount) a couple of rewritten, Python to Hylang, [TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn scripts](./hy-cv) and the [IPython notebooks](./machine-learning-and-a-bit-of-data-science).

In order to run all examples it is recommended to use virtual environments.
As a reminder:
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements # if available
# OR
pip install necessary_libraries_in_comma_separated_fashion
```
