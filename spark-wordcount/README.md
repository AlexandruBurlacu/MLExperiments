# Spark WordCount Project

This Spark application is a WordCount application with some enhancements,
like stop words removal and lower casing, on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.

Books are in `.txt` format, both taken from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).

## ToDo:
- add RegEx tokenization
- use stemming/lemmatization

### [Update Oct 2017]
Well, I think I'll rather write another example in Spark. I'm too lazy to add features in this one.
